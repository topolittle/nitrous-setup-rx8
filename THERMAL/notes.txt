Thermal managment:
Power to dissipate inside the enclosure: 200mA * 12V = 2.4W
Surface area of the enclosue: 0.4 ft-sqr
Watt per square foot: 6
Temperature rise: 15.5C (approx)
Expected max ambiant: 40C, so it gives us a max temperature of 55.5C inside the case,
just below of the glass transition temperature of the PLA which is 65C. ABS appears more suited for
this job since its glass transition temperature is around 105C.
